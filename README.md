Vision & Purpose
Improving Police Decision-Making:
Supports officers with advice grounded in national/local policy, leveraging AI to process information from trusted sources such as the College of Policing, CPS Guidance, and local force policies.

Human in the Loop:
Augments (but does not replace) human decision-making, supporting College of Policingâ€™s four key areas: Criminal Justice, Investigations, Prevention, and Neighbourhood Policing.

Key Features
Comprehensive Support: Advice across Criminal Justice, Investigations, Prevention, and Neighbourhood Policing.
Transparency & Trust: Every answer includes source citations.
Continuous Improvement: Regular audits, user feedback, and daily data updates.
Security & Compliance: Operates within a secure, compliant Azure environment.
Efficiency: Fast, speech-enabled access to information.
Seamless Integration: Works with local/national policies and Azure services.
How It Works
Data Integration:
Curated sources (e.g., College of Policing APP, CPS Guidance, Gov.uk) are indexed daily. Local force policies are managed centrally in Azure Storage.

AI Model:
Runs securely on a Police Service Azure Tenant using a self-contained version of OpenAI, delivering human-like responses to technical, procedural, and legislative queries.

Interface:
User-friendly chatbot/search interface, including speech-to-text for mobile efficiency.

Transparency:
Every response includes references/citations for provenance and trust.

Workflow Diagram:
(Add a diagram here illustrating data flow from sources to the AI assistant and the user interface)

Key Benefits
Enhanced Decision-Making: Reliable, up-to-date guidance from official sources.
Efficiency: Quick access to advice, saving officer time.
Comprehensive Coverage: Integrates both national and local information.
Transparency: Citations and reminders in every response.
Continuous Improvement: Daily data indexing and user-driven refinements.
Security: Strong data protection and compliance with legal standards.
