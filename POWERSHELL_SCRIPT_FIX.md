# PowerShell Script Syntax Fix

## Issue
The `setup_search_components.ps1` script failed during Azure deployment with syntax errors:

### Error Details
```
System.Management.Automation.ParseException: At /mnt/azscripts/azscriptinput/setup_search_components.ps1:266 char:42
+                     }                    contentFields = @(
+                                          ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Unexpected token 'contentFields' in expression or statement.
```

And similar errors around lines 263-275 and 335-383 related to missing closing braces and parentheses.

## Root Cause
Two syntax errors in the PowerShell script:

1. **Line 266**: Missing closing brace `}` after the `titleField` section in the semantic search configuration
2. **Line 367**: Missing line break and proper spacing after the `fieldMappings` closing parenthesis

## Fix Applied

### 1. Fixed Semantic Search Configuration (Line 263-270)
**Before:**
```powershell
titleField = @{
    fieldName = "title"
}                    contentFields = @(
```

**After:**
```powershell
titleField = @{
    fieldName = "title"
}
contentFields = @(
```

### 2. Fixed Indexer Field Mappings (Line 360-367)
**Before:**
```powershell
}
)    outputFieldMappings = @(
```

**After:**
```powershell
}
)
outputFieldMappings = @(
```

## Resolution Status
✅ **Fixed**: PowerShell script now has correct syntax
✅ **Validated**: No syntax errors found in the script
✅ **Ready**: Script should now execute successfully during Azure deployment

## Files Modified
- `scripts/setup_search_components.ps1` - Fixed syntax errors in semantic search configuration and indexer field mappings

## Next Steps
The Azure deployment should now complete successfully with the search components properly configured. The script will:
1. Create the Azure Cognitive Search data source
2. Create the search index with semantic search capabilities
3. Create the skillset for text processing and AI embeddings
4. Create and start the indexer to process documents

## Note
These were simple syntax errors (missing braces/spacing) and did not affect the logic or functionality of the search setup script.
