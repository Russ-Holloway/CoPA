# Search Setup Fixes Summary

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. **API Version Compatibility** ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: PowerShell script was using outdated API version `2020-06-30` which doesn't support:
- Vector search capabilities
- Azure OpenAI skills
- Modern indexer features

**Solution**: Updated to `2023-07-01-Preview` in `setup_search_components.ps1`

### 2. **Storage Account Configuration** ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: 
- Hardcoded storage account name `stcopuksopenai` 
- Container name mismatch between template and script
- Missing dependencies in deployment template

**Solution**: 
- Updated deployment template to use dynamic storage account names
- Fixed container name variables to be consistent
- Added proper dependency chains in ARM template

### 3. **Skillset Architecture** ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: 
- Script created two separate skillsets but indexer only referenced one
- Output field mappings expected fields from both skillsets
- Could cause indexer failures

**Solution**: 
- Combined skillsets into one comprehensive skillset
- Simplified indexer configuration to reference single skillset
- Ensured all output mappings have corresponding skills

### 4. **OpenAI Deployment References** ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: 
- Hardcoded `gpt-4o` deployment name in PowerShell script
- Deployment name might not match actual Azure OpenAI deployment

**Solution**: 
- Added parameter for GPT deployment name
- Updated ARM template to pass correct deployment name
- Made embedding deployment validation more robust

### 5. **Error Handling and Debugging** ✅ IMPROVED
**Problem**: 
- Limited error information when script failed
- No connectivity validation
- Difficult to troubleshoot deployment issues

**Solution**: 
- Added comprehensive error logging with HTTP response details
- Added connectivity tests for all Azure services
- Increased deployment timeout from 30 to 60 minutes
- Added validation for OpenAI deployments

### 6. **Deployment Template Corrections** ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: 
- String length violations for storage account names
- Missing dependencies for deployment script
- Hardcoded values instead of using variables

**Solution**: 
- Updated storage account naming to use `uniqueString()` for uniqueness
- Shortened container names to avoid 63-character limit
- Fixed all resource references to use proper variables
- Added storage container as dependency for deployment script

## Key Files Modified

### `scripts/setup_search_components.ps1`
- Updated API version to `2023-07-01-Preview`
- Combined skillsets into comprehensive skillset
- Added connectivity tests and enhanced error handling
- Fixed OpenAI deployment parameter handling

### `infrastructure/deployment.json`
- Fixed storage account naming and dependencies
- Updated deployment script arguments and timeout
- Corrected container name variables
- Added proper resource dependencies

### New Documentation
- `SEARCH_SETUP_TROUBLESHOOTING.md` - Comprehensive troubleshooting guide

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Deploy to Test Environment**: Test the updated ARM template in a clean resource group
2. **Monitor Deployment Logs**: Check the `setupSearchComponents` deployment script logs
3. **Verify Components**: After deployment, confirm in Azure Portal:
   - Search service has index with vector fields
   - Skillset exists with all skills
   - Indexer is created and running
   - Storage container exists

4. **Upload Test Documents**: Upload sample documents to test the full pipeline

## Fallback Strategy
If PowerShell script still fails, the Python application (`backend/search_setup.py`) provides identical functionality and will run automatically on app startup as a fallback.

## Next Steps
1. Test deployment with "Deploy to Azure" button
2. Monitor deployment script execution in Azure Portal
3. Verify search components are created correctly
4. Upload sample documents to test search functionality
