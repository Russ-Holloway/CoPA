# Citation Panel 60/40 Split Implementation - Complete

## Problem Solved
The user reported that the citation panel was too narrow because it was constrained by the same parent container as the answer content. Previous attempts to make the citation panel wider through global CSS overrides were unsuccessful because they targeted the wrong component.

## Root Cause Identified
The issue was **NOT** with the global citation panel (in Chat component), but with the **inline citation panel** that appears next to each answer in the Answer component. This inline citation panel was set to a fixed width of only `250px`, making it quite narrow.

## Solution Implemented
Modified the Answer component's layout to use a **60% answer / 40% citation split** using CSS flexbox proportions instead of fixed widths.

### Changes Made

#### File: `/workspaces/CoPPA/frontend/src/components/Answer/Answer.module.css`

**Before (narrow fixed width):**
```css
.answerColumn {
  flex: 1 1 0; /* Take remaining space after citation panel */
  min-width: 0;
}

.externalCitationColumn {
  flex: 0 0 250px; /* Smaller fixed width for citation panel */
  max-width: 250px;
  min-width: 220px;
}
```

**After (60/40 proportional split):**
```css
.answerColumn {
  flex: 3; /* 60% of space (3/5) */
  min-width: 0;
}

.externalCitationColumn {
  flex: 2; /* 40% of space (2/5) */
  min-width: 300px; /* Larger minimum for better readability */
  max-width: 500px; /* Reasonable maximum to prevent excessive width */
}
```

#### Responsive Design Updates

**Tablet (768px and below):**
- Maintained the 60/40 proportion
- Adjusted minimum/maximum widths for tablet screens
- Citation panel: `min-width: 280px`, `max-width: 400px`

**Mobile (480px and below):**
- Kept existing vertical stacking layout
- No changes needed for mobile experience

## How It Works

The Answer component uses this layout structure:
```jsx
<Stack horizontal className={styles.mainAnswerLayout}>
  {/* Answer content - 60% */}
  <Stack.Item grow className={styles.answerColumn}>
    {/* Answer text and content */}
  </Stack.Item>
  
  {/* Citation panel - 40% */}
  {showInlineCitation && activeCitation && (
    <Stack.Item className={styles.externalCitationColumn}>
      {/* Citation content */}
    </Stack.Item>
  )}
</Stack>
```

## Benefits

## Size Comparison

| Container Width | Answer Width (60%) | Citation Width (40%) | Old Citation Width | Improvement |
|----------------|-------------------|---------------------|-------------------|-------------|
| 1000px         | 600px            | 400px              | 250px             | +60%        |
| 1200px         | 720px            | 480px              | 250px             | +92%        |
| 800px (tablet) | 480px            | 320px              | 250px             | +28%        |

## Why This Solution Works

1. **Targeted the Right Component**: Instead of trying to override global citation panels, this fixes the actual inline citation panel in the Answer component.

2. **Uses Flex Proportions**: Instead of fixed widths, uses `flex: 3` and `flex: 2` to create a true 60/40 split that adapts to any container size.

3. **Maintains Responsive Design**: Tablet and mobile layouts remain optimized for their respective screen sizes.

4. **No Container Constraints**: The citation panel is no longer artificially constrained by a small fixed width.

## User Impact

- **Significantly Better Readability**: Citation panel is now 60-92% wider
- **Proper Space Utilization**: Makes better use of available screen space
- **Improved User Experience**: Easier to read citation content while maintaining good answer visibility
- **No Layout Issues**: No horizontal scrolling or layout breaking

The citation panel is now properly sized as a **40% proportion** of the available space, giving users much more room to read citation content while maintaining an optimal balance with the answer text.
