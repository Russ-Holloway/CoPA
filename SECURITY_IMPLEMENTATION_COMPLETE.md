## 🎯 Security Best Practices Implemented

### 1. Defense in Depth
- **Multiple security layers** - Network, application, data, identity
- **Redundant controls** - If one fails, others provide protection  
- **Comprehensive monitoring** - End-to-end security visibility

### 2. Zero Trust Architecture
- **Never trust, always verify** - Continuous authentication and authorization
- **Microsegmentation** - Granular access controls
- **Least privilege access** - Minimum necessary permissions

### 3. Continuous Security
- **Automated scanning** - Every commit and deployment
- **Real-time monitoring** - 24/7 security oversight
- **Continuous improvement** - Regular updates and enhancements

## 🚨 Incident Response Integration

### Automated Detection
- **Real-time alerts** for security events
- **Anomaly detection** using machine learning
- **Threat intelligence** integration
- **Automated containment** for known threats

### Response Procedures
1. **Detection** (< 15 minutes)
2. **Analysis and Containment** (< 1 hour)
3. **Eradication and Recovery** (< 4 hours)
4. **Post-incident Review** (< 1 week)

## 📈 Performance Impact

### Minimal Performance Overhead
- **Git hooks** - Add ~2-3 seconds per commit/push
- **Security scanning** - Runs in parallel with CI/CD
- **Monitoring** - Lightweight agents with < 1% CPU impact
- **Encryption** - Modern hardware acceleration support

### Optimized for Police Operations
